# Dynamic-Instruction-Scheduling

The project was undertaken as part of ECE 521: Computer Design and Technology (Computer Architecture)

Project Details:

The project was implemented in C++ for Linux machines.
The Simulator modelled an Out-Of-Order Superscalar processor that fetches and issues multiple instructions per cycle.

The Simulator analysed the effect of varying the ReOrder Buffer (ROB) size, instruction issue window, imperfect instruction cache and prefetching on the Instructions Per Cycle(IPC)
